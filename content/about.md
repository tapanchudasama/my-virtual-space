I am a software engineer working at **[Postman](https://postman.com)**. 

I believe writing code is a art. And this website is one such example of the art that I have created.

I use this site to mainly jot down my ideas and save some good "things" that I come across on the internet, basically as my own virtual space.

Here you can find the list of all things:

- things i have written at [/blog](/blog)
- things that i have build at [/side-projects](/side-projects)
- good reads that i have encountered till now at [/reads](/reads)
- what i am currently doing at [/now](/now)
