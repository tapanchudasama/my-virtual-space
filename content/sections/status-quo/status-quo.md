I am currently working as a software engineer at **[Postman](https://postman.com)**.

Previously I worked as a frontend engineer at a startup called **[eka.care](https://eka.care)**.

In Postman, I work in version control team. As the name says, we work on creating a version control system similar to git, but extremely user friendly and especially focused keeping APIs in mind.
