(Low Performance Score results as we make an fetch request to Spotify's API to get the currently playing, and the extra JS which is introduced due to Google Analytics)
## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use `git` to clone the site and navigate into it:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/tapanchudasama/my-virtual-space project-name
    cd project-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies.**

    ```shell
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Open the code and start customizing!**
	Start the site by running  `yarn start`.

	Your site is now running at  `http://localhost:8000`!
