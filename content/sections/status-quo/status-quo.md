I am currently working as a software developer in frontend for a startup called **[eka.care](https://eka.care).**

<br/>

We are creating a tool for doctor which allows them to completely shift their everyday practice online. The tool allows doctor to create prescriptions, store the medical history of patients, view their lab reports and manage appointments for his clinic among many other things.
