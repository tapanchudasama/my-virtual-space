1. **Headphones**: Bose's [QC 45](https://www.boseindia.com/en_in/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/quietcomfort-headphones-45.html). Amazing ANC. Amazing sound. Next level comfort.
2. **Monitor**: [LG 27UP650](https://www.lg.com/in/monitors/uhd-4k-5k/27up650-w/). Plain and simple. 4K. 27 inch. No gimmicky stuff. Just does the job.
3. **Browser**: [Arc](https://arc.net/) by The Browser Company. Truly changes the browsing experience. Revolutionary stuff. Hit me up if you want an invite.
4. **Terminal**: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). Simple. Fast. Supports ZSH.
5. **Spotlight**: [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/). At this point in time, if you are not using this, you are truly missing out on some great experience.
6. **Fonts**: [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/). Found this fonts when a guy posted about these on Twitter. Immediately liked it. Also [tweeted](https://twitter.com/tapanchudasama7/status/1603757501467348997?s=20&t=AAbM0imH4SBCr5uYSPWs9A) about my liking for this. (Fun fact: [here](/toolkit/fonts) a list of all fonts I've used till now.)
7. **Code Editor**: VSCode. Shouldn't be a question now. Github Dark is the theme I use.
