1. **Browser**: [Arc](https://arc.net/) by The Browser Company. Truly changes the browsing experience. Revolutionary stuff. Hit me up if you want an invite.
2. **Terminal**: [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/). A terminal written in Rust. Extremely Fast. And can also work as a full-fledged code editor.
3. **Spotlight**: [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/). At this point in time, if you are not using this, you are truly missing out on some great experience.
4. **Fonts**: [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/). Found this fonts when a guy posted about these on Twitter. Immediately liked it. Also [tweeted](https://twitter.com/tapanchudasama7/status/1603757501467348997?s=20&t=AAbM0imH4SBCr5uYSPWs9A) about my liking for this.
5. **Code Editor**: VSCode. Shouldn't be a question now. Github Dark is the theme I use.
